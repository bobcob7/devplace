# DevPlace

The DevPlace project is a kubernetes dashboard to bring up and manage workspaces for developers.
A workspaces is comprised of serveral services in it's own cluster.

# Example
Working on a large project project using a messaging bus and several microservices.

Ideally a developer would not need to modify or run more that 1 microservice at a time.
However, due to poor design, or constrained resources, this happens.

This is DevPlace comes in. A team member can bring up a workspace with all the resources that they could want within seconds.
